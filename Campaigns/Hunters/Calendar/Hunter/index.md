### 4th
Astrid was awoken in the middle of the night, recieving some push from her patron, Dugmaren Brightmantle, to seek out the cause to some disturbance in the flux of time. The cleric sniffs out the cause of the disturbance, leading her to Das Schwarze Schaf. She joins the group of adventurers in the revelry, which is soon relocated to a differnet tavern, Temnitsa, in the catacobms beneath Pitrograd. After some merriment together, Shiva, Ling and Caio wander off to enjoy other distractions the club has to offer.

Shiva meets The Mistress, and is marked by the vampire... Ling shares a dance with a half-elf by the name of Jonathon Morgenstern. He asks for help in bringing his father down... Astrid overhears some plot of innvasion on the border with Littlewood.

Caio's distraction causes him to get into some trouble with the bar's owner, Senor Francec ("The Bull") - a Beannina noble exile turned crime boss. After some negotiation by Alaris, The Bull agrees to forgive Caio's behavior if the group looks into a nest of fleder in the ruins of a local church.
