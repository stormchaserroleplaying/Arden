# Hunters
Dark forests lurk beyond the borders of Tanem's most rural of villages, and the wilderness seems to have a mind of its own as it encroaches from all sides. For those poor souls who call these places their home, travelling bands of monster hunters can mean the difference between salvation and destruction at the hand of whatever comes creeping out of the woods at night... if you can afford them.
