## Personality
Shiva is generally distrustful. Depending on what suits her, she acts either aloof or superficially congenial. However, she reaches out desperately for love from those who she feels can provide it. The same void also fuels the rage with which she strikes out at the world, often on the behalf of the abused and down-trodden that mirror the horrors of her own life. 

## Drive
Little ties Shiva to any one place. Her only overarching goal is to understand her roots and why the power of the Abyss resides within her.
