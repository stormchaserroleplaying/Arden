# Beschcadik
The imperial capital of the Sarameian Empire is one of the world's largest cities with a population of around 70,000. It's a sprawling metropolis with a layout that reflects both its ancient heritage and strategic coastal location.

Beschcadik is divided into six core districts (*Kasir Althour*, *Bazgharik*, *Marzaqar*, *Nahrzin*, *Djezirak* and *Ataljur*) and two surrounding areas (*Sharhinz* and *Ajal Jafra*).

## Kasir Althour
Built atop the largest hill near the coast, *Kasir Althour* is home to the emperor’s residence, and the *Halls of Concord*, where advisors and foreign emissaries gather. The hill offers a panoramic view of the city, the sparkling bay to the west, and the sprawling desert to the east. A grand stairway, flanked by bronze statues of past emperors, leads up to this elevated quarter, symbolizing the ascent to power.

## Bazgharik
Encircling the *Kasir Althour* is *Bazgharik*, the oldest part of Beschcadik. Narrow, cobbled streets wind through clusters of stone buildings, libraries, bathhouses and artisans’ workshops. The *Seyrnama Majida* stands here as the city’s spiritual heart, its grand dome visible from nearly every district. *Bazgharik* is also home to the *Bazaar of A Thousand Stars*, an expansive market where traders from across the empire and beyond sell spices, silks, jewelry and rare manuscripts.

### Seyrnama Majida
This sacred structure is central to both the spiritual life of the Sarameian people and the political prestige of the empire. The *Seyrnama Majida* was originally constructed by an early Sarameian emperor, a visionary ruler who sought to unify the empire's diverse faiths under one roof. The interior of the temple dazzles with intricate tile mosaics depicting scenes from Sarameian mythology, while massive, dome-topped chambers are illuminated by skylights casting filtered, coloured light. Within its walls, clergy from the empire’s most ancient faiths conduct rituals, hold council and tend to libraries of sacred texts, while the emperor himself is ceremonially crowned here.

## Marzaqar
The western coast of the city forms a bustling hub of maritime commerce. *Marzaqar* is a hive of activity, with ships anchored along deep-water docks and wharves. Warehouses, fish markets and trade halls fill the area. There is also the *Mariner’s Guild Hall*, a towering structure adorned with the carved figureheads of ships from distant lands, where merchants and sailors negotiate deals and host celebrations. A stone seawall protects this district from high tides and winter storms.

## Nahrzin
Following the river that cuts through Beschcadik, *Nahrzin* is an essential part of city life. Numerous stone bridges connect the two sides, lined with vendors, street musicians and hawkers. This district is known for its *Gardens of Song*, a series of public gardens and fountains gifted by past emperors, where citizens gather for festivals and poets recite verses. The quarter also contains mills, waterwheels and irrigation channels that sustain the farmland just beyond the city limits.

## Djezirak
The eastern edge of Beschcadik borders the arid sands and serves as the city’s gateway to the desert. *Djezirak* is populated by traders and nomadic families who often travel between the empire’s inner cities and Beschcadik. Camel markets and caravanserais dominate the area, alongside the *House of the Sun's Path*, a temple complex devoted to celestial observance and navigation. This district is particularly vibrant during festival seasons, with colourful tents and open-air performances celebrating desert lore and legend.

## Ataljur
To the north and south, where the hills extend out from the coast, the nobility and influential families reside in opulent villas surrounded by terraced gardens. These villas overlook the sea and river, giving the elite a commanding view of the city and its surroundings. The *House of Echoes*, a famous theater built into the hillside, offers performances that draw audiences from across the empire.

## Sharhinz
East of *Nahrzin*, the fertile floodplains extend along the river’s path. Small villages, waterwheels and canals irrigate fields of grain, dates, and vegetables. The farmers rely on the river’s seasonal flooding, ensuring a steady supply of food to feed Beschcadik’s growing population.

## Ajal Jafra
Beyond the floodplains lies the vast expanse of the Sarameian desert, marked by rolling dunes and ancient, half-buried ruins. Desert caravans, led by skilled guides, depart from Beschcadik regularly, bringing salt, rare stones and desert herbs into the city.
