# Eldren
The vast forest of **Eldren** is the sovereign kingdom of the elves. Surrounded by the mountains of their dwarven allies on three of four sides and with a great moor separating them from the nation of Littlewood to the south, the Eldrani enjoy a relatively secluded existence. Nevertheless, they still profit from some trade downriver to Littlewood, across the Ice Cap Peaks to Breanne, or simply with their neighbours, the dwarves.

### Alignment
Forest guardians love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.

### Features

#### Exotic Weapon Training
You are trained with any weapon with the word “elven” in its name or properties.

#### Mask of the Wild
You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.

#### Speak with Small Beasts
Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with small or smaller beasts. Forest guardians love animals and often keep squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers and other creatures as beloved pets.

### Languages
You speak, read and write either Eldrani or Sylvan with native proficiency and the other with accented proficiency.

Eldrani is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Eldrani literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Eldrani ballads to their repertoires.
