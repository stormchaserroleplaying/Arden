# Lelistrel
The tropical rainforest of **Lelistrel** is the sovereign kingdom of the elves. Surrounded by the mountains of their dwarven allies on three of four sides and with a great moor separating them from the nation of Littlewood to the south, the Eldrani enjoy a relatively secluded existence. Nevertheless, they still profit from some trade downriver to Littlewood, across the Ice Cap Peaks to Breanne, or simply with their neighbours, the dwarves.

### Alignment
The Lelistreli love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect othersâ€™ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.
