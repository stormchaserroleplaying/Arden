## Ardath
The great plains of **Ardath** form a swathe of temperate grassland that stretches almost two-thousand miles from the Dwarven frontier of Debgazan in the east to the scorching Ardathian badlands in the west. The native barbarians live in nomadic, tribes scattered across the steppes and occasionally venture south across the mountains of the Great Barrier Range to raid the borders of the Sarameian Empire. So far, the arduous terrain has been enough to dissuade imperial 'pacification'.

## Breanne
The predominantly human kingdom of **Breanne** is the dominant force in south-eastern Adrianus, both in terms of territory and culture. The nation encompasses the fertile basin of three major rivers and is protected by natural barriers on almost all sides. The towering Ice Cap Peaks to the west, the frigid Norscan sea to the south, the balmy Hellenian gulf to the north and the treacherous Necorian channel to the west. Each of these obstacles makes invasion a risky proposition at best.

Breanne is a feudal kingdom, divided into the duchies of Aethelyard, Beaufort, Camwen, Quenlan, Radbourne and Shamley. Much like the nations of western Europe on Earth, each has its own unique culture, which has grown alongside the others for centuries. The knights of each duchy are responsible for the wellbeing of their lands, each sworn to this duty in the name of Brigantia, the Lady of the river, the primary deity worshipped in Breanne.

## Eldren
The vast forest of **Eldren** is the sovereign kingdom of the elves. Surrounded by the mountains of their dwarven allies on three of four sides and with a great moor separating them from the nation of Littlewood to the south, the Eldrani enjoy a relatively secluded existence. Nevertheless, they still profit from some trade downriver to Littlewood, across the Ice Cap Peaks to Breanne, or simply with their neighbours the dwarves.

## Hellenia
The states of **Hellenia** are a loose association of free cities scattered along the coast of a balmy, but arid region. Hellenia's major trade partners are Breanne to the south across the Hellenian Gulf and the dwarves to the west across the Hellenian Savanna. The northern reaches of the savanna eventually give way to the dense jungle of Lelistrel rainforest. The Hellenians are a hedonistic and carefree people, who put great value in their freedom from the oppression of larger powers. In fact, the threat of such an oppressor is one of the few things known to cause various city states to stop squabbling and unite against a common enemy.
