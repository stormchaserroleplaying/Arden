# The Republic of Littlewood
The Republic of Littlewood is a free, democratic nation inhabited primarily by halflings and gnomes. Most of the population is concentrated along a strip of farmland surrounding the eponymous Littlewood and it is here that the three major cities of Paragon, Five Towers and Eastfarthing can be found.

Littlewood lies south of the elven Kingdom of Eldren, west of the predominantly human Kingdom of Breanne and east of the Sarameian province of Tanem. To the south, beyond JÃ¶tnar Bay, lies the ever-present threat of the frozen isles of Norsca.
