# Fey
* **Changelings** can shift their face and form with a thought as a form of artistic and emotional expression.

* **Firbolg** tribes cloister in remote forest strongholds, spending their days in quiet harmony with the woods.

* **Satyrs** are merry fey humanoids with the legs and horns of a goat.

* **Shifters** can transform into bestial humanoids who combine the most fearsome aspects of flesh and fur.
