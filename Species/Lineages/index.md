# Extraplanar Bloodlines
* **Aasimar** have celestial blood, which gives them shining metallic hair, jewel-like eyes and lustrous skin.

* **Ifrit** blood burns with elemental fire, giving them reddened colouring and hair that flickers as if aflame.

* **Oread** blood is grounded in elemental earth. They are strong and solidly built, with stone-like skin and hair.

* **Sylph** blood is infused with elemental air. They tend to be pale and thin to the point of appearing delicate.

* **Tieflings** are the offspring of mortals and fiends, with traits to match, and are often shunned out of fear.

* **Undine** blood is slaked in elemental water. Their flesh mimics the colours of lakes, seas and oceans.
