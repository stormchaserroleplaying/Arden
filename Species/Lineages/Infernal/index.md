# Infernal
Simultaneously more and less than mortal, those with infernal lineage are the offspring of fiends. With otherworldly blood and traits to match, they are often shunned and despised out of reactionary fear. Most never know their fiendish sire, as the coupling that produced their curse occurred generations earlier. The taint is long-lasting and persistent, often manifesting at birth or sometimes later in life, as a powerful, though often unwanted, boon.

## Age
Those with infernal lineage mature at the same rate as others of their species, but enjoy an extended lifespan. For humans, this is typically around 200 years.

## Alignment
Despite their fiendish appearance and netherworld origins, the infernal offspring have a mortalâ€™s capacity to choose their fate. While many embrace their dark heritage and side with fiendish powers, others reject their darker predilections. Though the power of their blood calls nearly all to fury, destruction, and wrath, even the spawn of a succubus can become a saint and the grandchild of a pit fiend an unsuspecting hero.

## Appearance
No two with infernal blood look alike; the fiendish blood running through their veins manifests inconsistently, granting them an array of fiendish traits. One  might appear as a human with small horns, a barbed tail, and oddly colored eyes, while another might manifest a mouth of fangs, tiny wings, and claws, and yet another might possess the perpetual smell of blood, foul incenses, and brimstone. Typically, these qualities harken back in some way to the manner of fiend that spawned the bloodline, but even then the admixture of human and fiendish blood is rarely ruled by sane, mortal laws, and the vast flexibility it produces is a thing of wonder, running the gamut from oddly beautiful to utterly terrible.

## Size
Creatures with infernal lineage are about the same size and build as others of their species.
