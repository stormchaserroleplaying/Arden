# Celestial
Beings with celestial lineage have a significant amount of good outsider blood in their ancestry. Such a heritage can lie dormant for generations, only to appear suddenly in the child of two apparently ordinary parents.

## Age
Those with celestial lineage mature at the same rate as others of their species, but enjoy an extended lifespan. For humans, this is typically around 200 years.

## Alignment
While not always benevolent, creatures with celestial lineage are more inclined toward acts of kindness rather than evil. They gravitate toward faiths or organisations associated with celestials. Most societies interpret such births as good omens, though it must be acknowledged that some take advantage of the reputation of their kind, brutally subverting the expectations of others with acts of terrifying cruelty or abject venality. "It’s always the one you least suspect" is the axiom that they live by. They often lead double lives as upstanding citizens or false heroes, keeping their corruption well hidden. Thankfully, these few are the exception and not the rule.

## Appearance
Creatures with celestial lineage mostly look like others of their species, except for some minor physical traits that reveal their unusual heritage. Typical features include hair that shines like metal, jewel-toned eyes, lustrous skin colour, or even glowing, golden halos.

## Size
Characters with celestial lineage are slightly taller than others of their species.
