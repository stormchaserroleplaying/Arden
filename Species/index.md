# Species
The following sections appear in the descriptions of most species:

## Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the species is considered an adult, as well as the species' expected lifespan.

## Alignment
A few specific species, such as dragonkin, originate from bloodlines that have strong inclinations towards specific alignments. These are not binding for player characters, who may overcome their nature through great effort. However, this can lend a certain flavour to a character's story.

## Appearance
A brief description of the typical appearance of a member of the species.

## Phenotype
Some species can be classified into distinct phenotypical groupings. Members of a given phenotype have all of the features of their species, along with some specific to their phenotype. Relationships among phenotypical groups vary significantly.

## Size
This tells you the physical size of members of the species. To randomly determine a character's height, roll the modifier dice indicated on the table below and add the result, in inches, to the base height for your character's race and gender. To determine a character's weight, multiply the result of the modifier dice by the weight multiplier and add the result to the base weight for your character’s race and gender.

Alternatively, you can choose your character’s height and weight based on the information provided in the table.
